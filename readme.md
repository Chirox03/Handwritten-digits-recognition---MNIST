# Introduction
This is the source code for a simple Handwritten Digits Recognition model using a 3 layers Neural Network.
# Training paramete
The data set using for training and evaluating is MNIST, including a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples.

The model is a 3-layer neural network (784 - 86 - 10), trained with learning rate = 0.015.
# Run code
Open the HandwrittenDigits_recognition.ipynb using Google Colab or Jupiter Notebook.
